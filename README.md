## Project Overview & Goals

This project serves as a comprehensive **E-commerce Web API** backend built using **ASP.NET Core** and **Entity Framework Core**. It was primarily developed as a training project to strengthen **backend development skills** and demonstrate practical experience in building a scalable, maintainable, and well-structured application.

The core focus is providing a structured system for managing users, products, and a complete order lifecycle within an online shopping environment.

### Core Objectives:

* Implement the **Onion Architecture** for clean separation of concerns and maintainability.
* Provide a full **Order Management System** (from basket creation through payment).
* Showcase expertise in advanced **.NET** patterns and performance optimization (e.g., **Redis Caching**, **Specification Pattern**).

## Key Features

This API implements several advanced patterns and functionalities to ensure a high-quality, high-performance system:

| Category | Feature | Technical Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architecture** | **Onion Architecture** | Ensures clean separation between core domain, application, and infrastructure layers. |
| **Performance** | **Redis Caching** ‚ö° | Reduces database load and lowers latency for frequently accessed product data. |
| **Transactions** | **Full Order Management System** | Handles the entire lifecycle: Basket $\rightarrow$ Checkout $\rightarrow$ Payment via **Stripe Integration**. |
| **Security** | **JWT Authentication & Authorization** | Robust security measures, including role-based access control (Admin, Buyer). |
| **Data Management** | **CRUD Operations** | Complete functionality for managing Products, Brands, and Types. |
| **Querying** | **Specification Pattern** | Used for flexible, reusable, and testable filtering, sorting, and pagination logic. |
| **Design Patterns** | **Repository + Unit of Work** | Decouples data access logic and ensures control over database transactions. |
| **Utilities** | **AutoMapper & Exception Handling** | **AutoMapper** for clean DTO mapping and **Centralized Exception Handling** for consistent error responses. |
